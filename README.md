# Perfume-Case-Study

This Github folder provides the training data for ANN training data, ANN model coefficient, SVC training data, and SVC model parameters. 

For convenient demonstration, the final rating with a scale [0, 100] is equal to { 100 / (1 + exp(-2.19402 * q)) }; q is calculated using the ANN coefficient.
